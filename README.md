# Comparison of missing data handling methods for variant pathogenicity predictors

## Description

This project compares methods for handling missing data in variant annotations for the purpose of building variant pathogenicity predictors.

See [the paper](docs/paper/paper.pdf) for a more detailed description. 

## Results data

The result files are available in [Zenodo with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6656616](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6656616).

## Open science
