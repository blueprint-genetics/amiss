A list of all potential nsSNVs and ssSNVs based on the human reference sequence were created and functional predictions and annotations were curated and compiled for each SNV. Here, we report a recent major update of the database to version 3.0. The SNV list has been rebuilt based on GENCODE 22 and currently the database includes 82,832,027 nsSNVs and ssSNVs. An attached database dbscSNV, which compiled all potential human SNVs within splicing consensus regions and their deleteriousness predictions, add another 15,030,459 potentially functional SNVs. Eleven prediction scores (MetaSVM, MetaLR, CADD, VEST3, PROVEAN, 4× fitCons, fathmm-MKL, and DANN) and allele frequencies from the UK10K cohorts and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), among others, have been added. The original seven prediction scores in v2.0 (SIFT, 2× Polyphen2, LRT, MutationTaster, MutationAssessor, and FATHMM) as well as many SNV and gene functional annotations have been updated. dbNSFP v3.0 is freely available at http://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP.},

abstract = {Abstract With the advance of sequencing technologies, whole exome sequencing has increasingly been used to identify mutations that cause human diseases, especially rare Mendelian diseases. Among the analysis steps, functional prediction (of being deleterious) plays an important role in filtering or prioritizing nonsynonymous SNP (NS) for further analysis. Unfortunately, different prediction algorithms use different information and each has its own strength and weakness. It has been suggested that investigators should use predictions from multiple algorithms instead of relying on a single one. However, querying predictions from different databases/Web-servers for different algorithms is both tedious and time consuming, especially when dealing with a huge number of NSs identified by exome sequencing. To facilitate the process, we developed dbNSFP (database for nonsynonymous SNPs' functional predictions). It compiles prediction scores from four new and popular algorithms (SIFT, Polyphen2, LRT, and MutationTaster), along with a conservation score (PhyloP) and other related information, for every potential NS in the human genome (a total of 75,931,005). It is the first integrated database of functional predictions from multiple algorithms for the comprehensive collection of human NSs. dbNSFP is freely available for download at http://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/dbNSFP.

CADD is an integrative annotation built from more than 60 genomic features, and can score human single nucleotide variants and short insertion and deletions anywhere in the reference assembly. CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants that have arisen and become fixed in human populations since the split between humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having survived millions of years of purifying selection. Here we review the latest updates to CADD, including the most recent version, 1.4, which supports the human genome build GRCh38. We also present updates to our website that include simplified variant lookup, extended documentation, an Application Program Interface and improved mechanisms for integrating CADD scores into other tools or applications.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Prioritizing missense variants for further experimental investigation is a key challenge in current sequencing studies for exploring complex and Mendelian diseases. A large number of in silico tools have been employed for the task of pathogenicity prediction, including PolyPhen-2, SIFT, FatHMM, MutationTaster-2, MutationAssessor, Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion, LRT, phyloP, and GERP++, as well as optimized methods of combining tool scores, such as Condel and Logit. Due to the wealth of these methods, an important practical question to answer is which of these tools generalize best, that is, correctly predict the pathogenic character of new variants. We here demonstrate in a study of 10 tools on five datasets that such a comparative evaluation of these tools is hindered by two types of circularity: they arise due to (1) the same variants or (2) different variants from the same protein occurring both in the datasets used for training and for evaluation of these tools, which may lead to overly optimistic results. We show that comparative evaluations of predictors that do not address these types of circularity may erroneously conclude that circularity confounded tools are most accurate among all tools, and may even outperform optimized combinations of tools.},

   abstract = {The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

abstract="The presence of missing values in a dataset can affect the performance of a classifier constructed using that dataset as a training sample. Several methods have been proposed to treat missing data and the one used most frequently deletes instances containing at least one missing value of a feature. In this paper we carry out experiments with twelve datasets to evaluate the effect on the misclassification error rate of four methods for dealing with missing values: the case deletion method, mean imputation, median imputation, and the KNN imputation procedure. The classifiers considered were the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and the KNN classifier. The first one is a parametric classifier whereas the second one is a nonparametric classifier.",

    abstract = "{Motivation: Gene expression profile analyses have been used in numerous studies covering a broad range of areas in biology. When unreliable measurements are excluded, missing values are introduced in gene expression profiles. Although existing multivariate analysis methods have difficulty with the treatment of missing values, this problem has received little attention. There are many options for dealing with missing values, each of which reaches drastically different results. Ignoring missing values is the simplest method and is frequently applied. This approach, however, has its flaws. In this article, we propose an estimation method for missing values, which is based on Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA). Although the methodology that a probabilistic model and latent variables are estimated simultaneously within the framework of Bayes inference is not new in principle, actual BPCA implementation that makes it possible to estimate arbitrary missing variables is new in terms of statistical methodology.Results: When applied to DNA microarray data from various experimental conditions, the BPCA method exhibited markedly better estimation ability than other recently proposed methods, such as singular value decomposition and K-nearest neighbors. While the estimation performance of existing methods depends on model parameters whose determination is difficult, our BPCA method is free from this difficulty. Accordingly, the BPCA method provides accurate and convenient estimation for missing values.Availability: The software is available at http://hawaii.aist-nara.ac.jp/~shige-o/tools/}",

    abstract = {As next-generation sequencing projects generate massive genome-wide sequence variation data, bioinformatics tools are being developed to provide computational predictions on the functional effects of sequence variations and narrow down the search of casual variants for disease phenotypes. Different classes of sequence variations at the nucleotide level are involved in human diseases, including substitutions, insertions, deletions, frameshifts, and non-sense mutations. Frameshifts and non-sense mutations are likely to cause a negative effect on protein function. Existing prediction tools primarily focus on studying the deleterious effects of single amino acid substitutions through examining amino acid conservation at the position of interest among related sequences, an approach that is not directly applicable to insertions or deletions. Here, we introduce a versatile alignment-based score as a new metric to predict the damaging effects of variations not limited to single amino acid substitutions but also in-frame insertions, deletions, and multiple amino acid substitutions. This alignment-based score measures the change in sequence similarity of a query sequence to a protein sequence homolog before and after the introduction of an amino acid variation to the query sequence. Our results showed that the scoring scheme performs well in separating disease-associated variants (n = 21,662) from common polymorphisms (n = 37,022) for UniProt human protein variations, and also in separating deleterious variants (n = 15,179) from neutral variants (n = 17,891) for UniProt non-human protein variations. In our approach, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the human and non-human protein variation datasets is ∼0.85. We also observed that the alignment-based score correlates with the deleteriousness of a sequence variation. In summary, we have developed a new algorithm, PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer), which provides a generalized approach to predict the functional effects of protein sequence variations including single or multiple amino acid substitutions, and in-frame insertions and deletions. The PROVEAN tool is available online at http://provean.jcvi.org.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The rate at which nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are being identified in the human genome is increasing dramatically owing to advances in whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing technologies. Automated methods capable of accurately and reliably distinguishing between pathogenic and functionally neutral nsSNPs are therefore assuming ever-increasing importance. Here, we describe the Functional Analysis Through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) software and server: a species-independent method with optional species-specific weightings for the prediction of the functional effects of protein missense variants. Using a model weighted for human mutations, we obtained performance accuracies that outperformed traditional prediction methods (i.e., SIFT, PolyPhen, and PANTHER) on two separate benchmarks. Furthermore, in one benchmark, we achieve performance accuracies that outperform current state-of-the-art prediction methods (i.e., SNPs\&GO and MutPred). We demonstrate that FATHMM can be efficiently applied to high-throughput/large-scale human and nonhuman genome sequencing projects with the added benefit of phenotypic outcome associations. To illustrate this, we evaluated nsSNPs in wheat (Triticum spp.) to identify some of the important genetic variants responsible for the phenotypic differences introduced by intense selection during domestication. A Web-based implementation of FATHMM, including a high-throughput batch facility and a downloadable standalone package, is available at http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk.},

 abstract = {The statistical literature and folklore contain many methods for handling missing explanatory variable data in multiple linear regression. One such approach is to incorporate into the regression model an indicator variable for whether an explanatory variable is observed. Another approach is to stratify the model based on the range of values for an explanatory variable, with a separate stratum for those individuals in which the explanatory variable is missing. For a least squares regression analysis using either of these two missing-data approaches, the exact biases of the estimators for the regression coefficients and the residual variance are derived and reported. The complete-case analysis, in which individuals with any missing data are omitted, is also investigated theoretically and is found to be free of bias in many situations, though often wasteful of information. A numerical evaluation of the bias of two missing-indicator methods and the complete-case analysis is reported. The missing-indicator methods show unacceptably large biases in practical situations and are not advisable in general.},

Here, we compared 12 performance measures of 23 methods based on three independent benchmark datasets: (i) clinical variants from the ClinVar database related to genetic diseases, (ii) somatic variants from the IARC TP53 and ICGC databases related to human cancers and (iii) experimentally evaluated PPARG variants. Some methods showed different performances under different conditions, suggesting that they were not always applicable for different conditions. Furthermore, the specificities were lower than the sensitivities for most methods (especially, for the experimentally evaluated benchmark datasets), suggesting that more rigorous cutoff values are necessary to distinguish pathogenic variants. Furthermore, REVEL, VEST3 and the combination of both methods (i.e. ReVe) showed the best overall performances with all the benchmark data. Finally, we evaluated the performances of these methods with de novo mutations, finding that ReVe consistently showed the best performance. We have summarized the performances of different methods under various conditions, providing tentative guidance for optimal tool selection.}",

VAAST builds on existing amino acid substitution (AAS) and aggregative approaches to variant prioritization, combining elements of both into a single unified likelihood framework that allows users to identify damaged genes and deleterious variants with greater accuracy, and in an easy-to-use fashion. VAAST can score both coding and noncoding variants, evaluating the cumulative impact of both types of variants simultaneously. VAAST can identify rare variants causing rare genetic diseases, and it can also use both rare and common variants to identify genes responsible for common diseases. VAAST thus has a much greater scope of use than any existing methodology. Here we demonstrate its ability to identify damaged genes using small cohorts (n = 3) of unrelated individuals, wherein no two share the same deleterious variants, and for common, multigenic diseases using as few as 150 cases.},

abstract = {Abstract High-throughput sequencing data generation demands the development of methods for interpreting the effects of genomic variants. Numerous computational methods have been developed to assess the impact of variations because experimental methods are unable to cope with both the speed and volume of data generation. To harness the strength of currently available predictors, the Pathogenic-or-Not-Pipeline (PON-P) integrates five predictors to predict the probability that nonsynonymous variations affect protein function and may consequently be disease related. Random forest methodology-based PON-P shows consistently improved performance in cross-validation tests and on independent test sets, providing ternary classification and statistical reliability estimate of results. Applied to missense variants in a melanoma cancer cell line, PON-P predicts variants in 17 genes to affect protein function. Previous studies implicate nine of these genes in the pathogenesis of various forms of cancer. PON-P may thus be used as a first step in screening and prioritizing variants to determine deleterious ones for further experimentation. Hum Mutat 33:1166–1174, 2012. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Existing tools utilize functional genomics data and evolutionary information to evaluate the pathogenicity or regulatory functions of non-coding variants.

Combining multiple methods may increase accuracy in regulatory variant prediction.Results: Here, we compiled an integrative resource for predictions from eight different tools on functional annotation of non-coding variants. We further developed a composite strategy to integrate multiple predictions and computed the composite likelihood of a given variant being regulatory variant. Benchmarked by multiple independent causal variants datasets, we demonstrated that our composite model significantly improves the prediction performance.Availability and Implementation: We implemented our model and scoring procedure as a tool, named PRVCS, which is freely available to academic and non-profit usage at http://jjwanglab.org/PRVCS.Contact:wang.junwen@mayo.edu, jliu@stat.harvard.edu, or limx54@gmail.comSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    Abstract = {Exome and genome sequencing reveal thousands to millions of genetic variants in a typical individual. A fundamental challenge in human genetics is isolating the small subset (typically one or two) of variants that cause a Mendelian disease phenotype. This Review describes the computational approaches used to prioritize variants in Mendelian disease.A multitude of tools prioritize variants on the basis of biochemical, evolutionary, allele segregation and population frequency characteristics in an attempt to prioritize the list of potential causative variants. The strategies and caveats associated with these tools are outlined in this Review.Burden tests take prioritization to the next level by aggregating the variants observed at a given locus to calculate a burden score for the gene. Most burden testing software tools also evaluate potentially damaging genotypes in the context of other genotypes observed at the same locus in a control population.Variant interpretation is the process of drawing direct connections from individual variants to disease phenotypes, and this process is central to both clinical reporting of results and incidental findings, as well as research endeavours that include variant discovery and return of results.Variant prioritization and interpretation are especially challenging for non-coding variants, structural variants and synonymous exonic variants. Furthermore, increasingly complex reference genomes introduce new demands for variant discovery tools. Each of these challenges drive increasingly sophisticated software solutions.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Next-generation sequencing methods have revolutionized the speed of generating variation information. Sequence data have a plethora of applications and will increasingly be used for disease diagnosis. Interpretation of the identified variants is usually not possible with experimental methods. This has caused a bottleneck that many computational methods aim at addressing. Fast and efficient methods for explaining the significance and mechanisms of detected variants are required for efficient precision/personalized medicine. Computational prediction methods have been developed in three areas to address the issue. There are generic tolerance (pathogenicity) predictors for filtering harmful variants. Gene/protein/disease-specific tools are available for some applications. Mechanism and effect-specific computer programs aim at explaining the consequences of variations. Here, we discuss the different types of predictors and their applications. We review available variation databases and prediction methods useful for variation interpretation. We discuss how the performance of methods is assessed and summarize existing assessment studies. A brief introduction is provided to the principles of the methods developed for variation interpretation as well as guidelines for how to choose the optimal tools and where the field is heading in the future.},

    Abstract = {To evaluate binary classifications and their confusion matrices, scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets.},
